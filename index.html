    <h1>Who am I?</h1>
    <p>Hey there. I am Muhammad Mukhtar Suleiman. I'm interested in people and what drives them. I'm passionate about the art and science of programming. I just really enjoy thinking about problems and trying to get to the bottom of them&#8212;which usually leads to solving them. I'm yet to find a field that presents more problems to be solved than computer science; and that's one of the reasons why I find it so attractive. I'm also interested in philosopy, motivation, pschology, discipline and knoeledge in general.</p>
